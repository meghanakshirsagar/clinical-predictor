**Limerick Digital Cancer Research Centre**  
Developed by: **Meghana Kshirsagar** and **Gauri Vaidya**

This project is a proof-of-concept of treatment personalization for patients with **Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)** using structured outcomes from completed clinical trials with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

It consists of two key components: one for generating patient profiles, and another for relevant treatment recommendations learned from trial outcome data.

## Usage Instructions

1. For demonstration purposes, this tool uses the clinical trial ID [NCT02268695](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02268695). However, users are encouraged to explore additional completed trials by selecting different NCT IDs from [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/).

2. Open the `Patient_Profile_Creation` notebook and substitute the nct_id with any other and run all cells to generate a patient profile based on the selected clinical trial.

3. Copy the generated patient profile and paste it into the `Patient_Profile_Treatment_Recommendation` notebook.

4. Run the treatment recommendation notebook to receive a personalized recommendation based on trial outcome data.
